        # Examples:
        # If requirements_CPU.txt is in a 'src' folder: pip install -r src/requirements_CPU.txt
        # If requirements_CPU.txt is in a 'config' folder: pip install -r config/requirements_CPU.txt
        # If it's in the root (and you still got the error), double check its exact name in your repo.
        # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
        pip install -r requirements_CPU.txt # KEEP THIS LINE, BUT MODIFY THE PATH if needed!
